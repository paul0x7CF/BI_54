Bonus Question. We identified the following points to have potential for improvement:

First and foremost, one could combine the Customer Dimension into a hierarchy (so instead of having Age, Gender, and FullName separately, this could be FullName -> Gender -> Age).

Next point is the missing (fully integrated) ShipMethod dimension. When working with on the query for 3_5, we noticed that we could have made good use of a ShipMethod dimension, e.g., for filtering for "Cargo International" in the MDX query. Since the dimension was missing, we pivoted to SQL, which was more straightforward.

Lastly, the Date dimension does currently not allow for a fine-granular query that, e.g., includes time with hours and minutes.
